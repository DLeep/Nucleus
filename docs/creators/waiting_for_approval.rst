Whilst waiting for approval
==================================================

We really hope that approval wont take too long, but even if it doesn't, below are some things to do whilst you wait.

Since you don't have access to the :ref:`mission_control` whilst you're waiting for approval, your best spending time making sure the infrastructure is in place, ready for when you go live.

.. rubric:: Repositories

If your project is likely going to use any repositories, now is the time to set them up. If you want some recommendations we've heard http://GitLab.com and http://Bitbucket.org are pretty good.

.. rubric:: Workspace

Are you going to be using external tools for anything? For instance, GoogleDrive for document sharing, or Trello for agile project management? If so, get them set up. Put as much content on there as possible!

.. rubric:: Documentation

If you haven't already, finish preparing your documentation and specifications.

What next?
------------

There's only so much you can do without access to the Mission Control, but if you find yourself absolutely dying to get going, then see if there's anything you can prepare in advance for the next step: :ref:`before_going_live`.
